# Agent-Based Modeling Project

This repository contains the **Agent-Based Modeling** project, created using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), a powerful tool for simulating complex systems.

## About the Project

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a computational methodology that enables the simulation of the interactions of autonomous agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole. This project focuses on [insert the key concept/topic your project models, e.g., "ecosystem dynamics, economic interactions, or social behavior patterns"].

### Key Features:
- **Custom Agent Behaviors**: Agents are programmed with distinct behaviors to interact with their environment and each other.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The environment reacts dynamically to the actions of the agents.
- **Visualization**: The project includes visualizations that allow users to observe patterns and emergent behaviors over time.

### Objectives:
The primary goal of this project is to [state your objective, e.g., "simulate X process," "explore Y concept," or "provide insights into Z behavior"].

## File Structure
- **`v2 Assignment Agent Based Modeling.nlogo`**: The main NetLogo file containing the code, interface, and logic for the simulation.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the repository (you are reading this file).
